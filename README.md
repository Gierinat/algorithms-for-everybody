<h1> Algorithms for Everybody </h1>

<h2> The content will be added gradually till the training day. </h2>

To view the code in different programming languages, please choose a branch: 

- [ ] [Golang](https://github.com/NigarMovsumova/algorithms-for-everybody/tree/golang)
- [ ] [Java](https://github.com/NigarMovsumova/algorithms-for-everybody/tree/java)
- [ ] [Python](https://github.com/NigarMovsumova/algorithms-for-everybody/tree/python)
- [ ] [JavaScript](https://github.com/NigarMovsumova/algorithms-for-everybody/tree/javascript)
- [ ] [C](https://github.com/NigarMovsumova/algorithms-for-everybody/tree/C)

2 extra programming languages will be added after the training. 
They will be chosen by the majority during the training.

To register for the training, [click here](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/algorithms-for-everybody/0636920064925/0636920064924/).

Future sessions will be added gradually.
